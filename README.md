### Why would I want this?

Whether you are a commercial farmer or someone who is prone to forgetting to water your favorite house plant from time to time, this system removes the guesswork from environmental factors and can automate most regular tasks related to plant care.

Plants are generally pretty awesome whether for eating, oxygen production, or decoration so anything we can do to enable more plants in our not-so-plant-friendly human habitats makes the world marginally better.

### How do I use this?

##### Step 1: Buy the open source hardware used for this project

##### Step 2: Install the required software
